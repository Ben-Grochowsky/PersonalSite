                This application was made to be a fighting game. The game starts asking what your name is and what race you wish to play as. After you choose your race and name it shows you a description of the room you are in and what enemy you have encountered. It then asks you if you would like to attack, run away, check the players stats, check the enemies stats, or leave the program. If you choose to attack it checks to see if your chance to hit is higher than their chance to block and randomly rolls to see if your attack and/or the enemies attack will land. If you choose to run away it rolls for the monster to see if it attacks you as you run away. Once you run away it generates a new room and a new monster for you to fight.
